              Glover, brothers, created an avenue to not only flex their respective skills, but also to be a source of
              change they wanted to see within their business and personal communities, thus Alex & Asher was born.

                  Jordon was a genius by the tender age of 6 months. With his intellectual prowess he knew his destiny
                  was to take over the world. The first step in world domination is to establish a business that caters
